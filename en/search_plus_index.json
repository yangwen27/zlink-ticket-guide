It supports running on both Windows and Android systems. Its core functionality is fundamentally the same as the handheld POS device, but its user interface (UI) and operational flow have been optimized for larger screens and more complex business scenarios. Key Features and Interface Compared to the handheld device, the main feature of the Window POS Terminal is its integration of richer functional modules and a tabbed interface that allows for quick switching between different business modes. Dual Mode: Ticket Sales / Card Sales The new version supports two core modes: \"Ticket Sales\" and \"Card Sales\". Operators can seamlessly switch between them on the same interface, greatly improving efficiency when handling mixed transactions (e.g., a visitor purchasing a ticket while also applying for a membership card). Integrated Membership Management Through the \"Card Sales\" mode, seamless integration between membership management and the ticketing system is achieved, supporting on-site card issuance, top-ups, and member information queries for visitors. Ticketing Interface In \"Ticket Sales\" mode, the interface displays all available tickets. Operators can quickly select tickets for visitors, add them to the cart, and complete the checkout process. The workflow is optimized for desktop use, making it more intuitive and efficient. Core Operations Guide The core business logic of the Window POS Terminal for ticketing, ticket exchange, refunds, receipt reprinting, and sales statistics is identical to that of the handheld POS device. For detailed step-by-step instructions on these functions, please refer to the following document: Handheld POS Ticketing.md Printer Settings As a window terminal, it typically needs to be connected to one or more receipt printers.

WeChat applets can be quickly opened by reusing the certification materials of the official account. An official account can open multiple applets, so we only need to certify the official account. If you already have an official account, you can directly open the applet. First, open the WeChat official account platform website https://mp.weixin.qq.com, and click Register Now to enter the registration page. Select the registered account type as a service account After registering the service account according to the prompts on the page, submit the certification. The certification fee is 300 yuan, and the review will generally be passed within a week. Open payment channel At present, our system supports WeChat native payment and Jialian payment. Jialian payment can support UnionPay, WeChat, and Alipay, with lower rates. Please contact our staff for the opening method. Purchase cloud server and domain name If you don't want to buy a server, you can also host the system on the server we provide. We can provide a second-level domain name for free. It is recommended to use Alibaba Cloud server https://www.aliyun.com Click to open the link Select the number and configuration of servers to be purchased according to the actual situation of the project. A single server is sufficient for small projects. It is recommended to use more than 2 servers for projects with large traffic and user volume, and the database and program are deployed separately. Of course, our system also supports cluster deployment. You can determine whether you need cluster deployment according to your actual situation. Purchase domain name After the domain name is registered and the real-name authentication is passed, it needs to be filed. The filing period is different in each place, and it is generally completed within 20 working days. After registering the domain name, you can open Alibaba Cloud's filing https://beian.aliyun.com/ to submit the website filing. The applet must use a filed domain name and SSL to be accessed normally. Alibaba Cloud provides a free SSL certificate, and using a free SSL certificate can meet the requirements of the applet. Use CDN to speed up system access Generally, in order to save server overhead costs, the server can choose a smaller network bandwidth and improve the system access speed through CDN. Enter Alibaba Cloud's CDN console to create a domain name CDN https://cdn.console.aliyun.com/ Open SMS (optional) If you need to send SMS notifications after users purchase tickets, you need to open Alibaba Cloud SMS. After the above work is ready, you can deploy and install the system.

Different roles will see different functions when logging into the background management system. To view the latest demo version, please visit https://ticket.anjian99.com Log in to the Zhonglian Ticketing System Open the backend URL, enter the username and password to log in. The default username is admin and the password is 000000 Backend homepage The upper part of the homepage provides quick access to various common functions, as well as key data indicators for the day. More detailed reports can be viewed in the report details. System Management System management is mainly for the management of background users/roles, permission settings, navigation menu management, and system log records. User Management The users here refer to the users who can log in to the background and the salesperson accounts of each ticket sales terminal. In the user management interface, we can add/edit users, modify user login passwords, enable/disable user accounts, and delete users (use the delete function with caution, if you don't want users to log in to the system, just disable them). Role management In the ticketing system, the permission control of each user account is realized through role management. A user can have multiple role identities, and a role can also include multiple users. By setting the page permissions of the role, the system functions that the user has can be controlled. Menu management Menu management is the setting and arrangement of the background navigation menu. By default, we have set all the menus. You can also adjust the menu according to your actual situation. After adjusting the menu, you need to click \"Refresh Menu\" and log in again to take effect. Log The log system will record background operations and API interface operation records. When the system has an exception, it will record detailed error information for operation and maintenance personnel to troubleshoot and refer to. The log recording level can be set through the configuration file. Under normal circumstances, the system will not actively delete any log records. If you feel that too many logs affect the system response, you can delete them manually. Basic settings The basic settings are mainly some parameter settings of the ticketing system, such as payment institution parameter settings, self-service machine parameter settings, applet parameter settings, official account parameter settings, OTA parameter settings and other parameter settings. Ticket classification and distribution channels are also placed in the basic settings. You can rearrange the menu according to your own preferences in the menu management. Parameter settings Ticket classification Although the system supports multi-level classification, for the convenience of operation on the ticket vending machine, it is recommended to only do first-level classification. Distribution channels The distribution channels here do not involve any settlement or commission, but are just for the convenience of statistics on the promotion of ground promotion personnel. If you want to reward them based on their merits, you can view the statistical data in the distribution statistics report. Ticket management Ticket management is the core part of the entire ticketing system. The setting of ticket types and the setting of ticket sales/checking permissions are all managed here. Ticket management Various ticket types (annual pass, package ticket, multi-ride ticket, etc.), ticket sales restrictions, promotion commissions, point rewards, and usage dates can be combined to generate different types of tickets. Due to the limited space, we will introduce in detail in another article how to generate various common ticket types through parameter combination. Ticket sales settings The ticket sales authority of each salesperson/ticket sales channel can be set. On the ticket sales interface, the salesperson can only see the tickets they are authorized to sell. Through the setting of ticket sales authority, we can easily realize that different channels sell different tickets. Through the setting of data authority, the salesperson can only see their own sales situation after logging into the background system. For specific data authority settings, please refer to Data Authority Settings Ticket checking equipment In our system, turnstiles, handheld ticket checkers, and ticket checking apps are collectively referred to as ticket checking equipment. The ticket checking equipment has two traffic directions: in and out. In some occasions, you need to swipe your card and scan the code for both in and out. Then we can achieve this by setting up two ticket checking equipment (one in and one out). The ticket checking equipment also has permission settings. Only when the ticket is checked can the equipment check the corresponding ticket. When the ticket checking equipment is no longer in use, you can delete the equipment. Usually, to ensure the integrity of the system data, we do not recommend that you delete the equipment, but recommend that you disable the equipment. Refund management You can initiate a refund here, and the amount will be returned to the original path. If the guest has already used the ticket, but cannot continue to experience the service corresponding to the ticket due to some factors, you can force a refund to the guest. It is worth noting that each ticket can only be refunded once, so the refund amount must be confirmed with the customer before initiating the refund. Commission and withdrawal This function corresponds to the distribution and promotion on the applet. Member users can get corresponding commissions by sharing the applet with friends and relatives, and friends can buy tickets on the applet. After getting the commission, members can apply for withdrawal on the applet. After the background staff approves it, they will transfer the money to the member. It is worth mentioning that the commission will not be credited immediately after a friend buys a ticket, but will be credited after the ticket is verified and used. Report details Here are the various reports, order details and payment documents of the system. Payment documents Payment documents refer to the transaction records of third-party payment institutions, including ticket orders and ticket refund orders. The data here can be used as a reconciliation statement with third-party payment institutions. The system has a transaction exception detection mechanism, and orders with payment timeout or payment exceptions will be automatically reversed by the system. Ticket checking records Record the usage of tickets Ticket orders This is the ticket sales details. It is specially explained that the \"export password\" function is used in conjunction with the \"password activation\" on the applet. The platform can issue passwords to members through the official account, and members can then activate the tickets through the password activation function. Distribution statistics The order statistics of offline ground promotion and distribution personnel, the reports here can be used as the basis for commission distribution Refund records The amount of refunds in the system is returned to the original path. This is only for recording. Whether the third-party payment is successfully refunded needs to be checked in the payment documents. Ticket statistics Statistics of the sales of each ticket by day in the form of charts, which can be filtered by time range and exported easily Channel statistics Different from distribution statistics, here the data is counted by salesperson (channel) Points and gifts Members can get points by purchasing tickets or signing in on the applet. After getting points, they can redeem gifts in the points mall. After redeeming gifts, they need to be verified in the background. Points record Record the changes of each member's points Gift management Add, delete, modify and check gifts. The added gifts will be displayed on the applet (only when \"available\" is checked). When members have enough points, they can redeem gifts. Gift exchange Users initiate exchanges on the applet, and the background reviews and verifies them before issuing gifts. Information Management You can publish some travel guides, event introductions or promotional articles. These articles will be displayed on the applet and self-service machines.

Step 1: Background Configuration Before using the handheld ticket inspector, you must complete the corresponding device account creation and permission configuration in the ticketing system background. 1. Create a ticket inspection device account For each handheld ticket inspection terminal, a corresponding \"ticket inspection device\" account needs to be created in the background. About inbound/outbound settings When creating a device, you need to specify it as \"inbound\" (ie, ticket inspection for entry) or \"outbound\" (ie, ticket inspection for exit). If your business scenario requires recording the entry and exit of tourists, you need to create different ticket inspection device accounts for the entrance and exit. 2. Set the tickets that can be inspected Important: For security and management reasons, the ticket inspection device cannot inspect any tickets by default. You must explicitly set the \"inspectable ticket\" range for each created ticket inspection device account. Unauthorized tickets will be prompted as invalid even if they are scanned with this device. Step 2: Device Operation Process 1. Initial configuration and login Set the server address: After turning on the machine for the first time or resetting it, click the gear icon in the upper right corner of the login page, and enter your background server URL address in the pop-up window. Login: Use the ticket inspection device account and password you created in the background to log in. 2.

Technical Description: This mini program is developed based on the Taro3 framework and can theoretically be compiled into mini programs for multiple mainstream platforms such as WeChat, Douyin, and Alipay. Currently, the standard version mainly provides the WeChat mini program version. About the interface: Some of the screenshots in the document are from the PC version of the mini program, and the actual display effect on the mobile phone will be more beautiful and coordinated. We provide a complete mini program API document. If you feel that the current UI style does not match your own brand, you can carry out secondary development of the front-end page based on the API. Home Page The design of the home page is centered on ticket sales. The upper part focuses on recommending tickets in the form of a carousel, and the lower part is a list of tickets, which is convenient for users to quickly find and purchase. Purchase Process Users can purchase tickets in two ways: \"Add to Cart\" or \"Buy Now\". Add to Cart: After clicking, if the ticket requires filling in tourist information (such as name, phone number, travel date, etc.), an information input box will pop up at the bottom. After filling in, the ticket will be added to the shopping cart. Tip: The tickets in the standard version of the mini program follow the \"one ticket, one code\" principle, so there is no quantity option when adding to the shopping cart. If you need to purchase multiple tickets, please repeat the \"Add to Cart\" operation. This logic can be modified in the customized version. Buy Now: After clicking, after filling in the necessary tourist information, you will be directly redirected to the order confirmation and payment page.

Lack of in-depth research on tourist needs, resulting in technology applications that are out of touch with actual needs and cannot truly enhance the tourist experience. Data silo problem: Data from different departments and systems cannot be shared, leading to repeated data collection, incomplete information, and the inability to conduct effective analysis and utilization. The data quality is not high, and there is a large amount of duplicate, wrong or missing data, which affects the reliability of the data. Lack of personalized services: Smart scenic spots often provide stereotyped services and cannot meet the personalized needs of tourists. Lack of in-depth mining and analysis of tourist behavior data, unable to achieve accurate personalized recommendations. Insufficient operation and maintenance: After the construction of smart scenic spots, there is a lack of effective operation and maintenance, leading to frequent problems such as equipment failure and system collapse, which affects the tourist experience. Insufficient personnel training, unable to skillfully operate and maintain the smart scenic spot system. Excessive commercialization: Some scenic spots pay too much attention to commercial interests, using the construction of smart scenic spots as a means of profit, ignoring the tourist experience and cultural heritage. Blind pursuit of high technology has led to excessive construction costs, which has affected the sustainable development of scenic spots. How to create a truly smart scenic spot Tourist-centered: Put the needs of tourists first, understand their behavior habits through big data analysis, and provide personalized and customized services. Strengthen data integration: Establish a unified data platform to realize the interconnection of data from various systems in the scenic spot and improve the efficiency of data utilization. Improve system stability: Strengthen system maintenance to ensure stable and reliable system operation and avoid failures. Focus on talent training: Strengthen the training of scenic spot staff to improve their ability to master the smart scenic spot system. Balance business and public welfare: Adhere to the balance between public welfare and commerciality, not only to ensure the economic benefits of the scenic spot, but also to pay attention to cultural heritage and social benefits. Strengthen top-level design: Formulate a scientific and reasonable construction plan for smart scenic spots, and clarify the development goals and paths. The development trend of smart scenic spots In-depth application of AI technology: Artificial intelligence technology will play an increasingly important role in smart scenic spots, such as face recognition, voice interaction, and intelligent tour guides. Popularization of AR/VR technology: Augmented reality and virtual reality technology will bring tourists a new immersive experience.

An in-depth interpretation from a cultural and tourism analyst \"Smart scenic spots\" have become a hot topic in recent years, but many tourists and industry insiders feel that many scenic spots have only put on the \"smart\" coat, and there is still a big gap from true intelligence. I will analyze the reasons why \"smart scenic spots are not smart\" from the following aspects, and try to propose some solutions: 1. Current situation analysis: common problems \"Emphasis on construction, neglect of operation\": Many scenic spots have invested a lot of money in building hardware facilities, such as sensors, cameras, networks, etc., but have neglected the construction, operation and maintenance of software platforms, resulting in the inability to effectively integrate and utilize data, and the hardware facilities are just for show. Serious \"information island\" phenomenon: The internal systems of the scenic spot lack interconnection and data cannot be shared, resulting in a fragmented tourist experience. For example, services such as ticket purchase, tour guide, parking, and catering are independent of each other, and tourists need to frequently switch between different applications, which is very inconvenient. Lack of in-depth mining of tourist needs: Many scenic spots simply move offline services online, and do not use data analysis technology to deeply understand tourist needs and provide personalized and customized services. Neglecting to empower management and services: The goal of building a smart scenic spot is not only to enhance the tourist experience, but also to optimize the management efficiency of the scenic spot and improve the quality of service. However, many scenic spots have not fully considered these aspects in the process of intelligent construction. 2. Constructive solutions: solving problems from the root Change concepts and be tourist-centered: The construction of smart scenic spots must always be guided by the needs of tourists, and the ultimate goal is to enhance the tourist experience, rather than simply pursuing the accumulation of technology. Pay attention to top-level design and build an integrated platform: Overall planning should be carried out in the early stage of construction to avoid \"information islands\", create a unified platform, integrate internal and external resources of the scenic spot, and achieve data sharing and business collaboration. Use data analysis to provide personalized services: Collect and analyze tourist data, accurately profile tourist groups, provide personalized recommendations, customized routes, intelligent customer service and other services to improve tourist satisfaction. Empower management and services to achieve cost reduction and efficiency increase: Use intelligent means to optimize the management process of scenic spots and improve work efficiency; at the same time, use data analysis to optimize scenic spot services, improve service quality, and achieve cost reduction and efficiency increase. 3. Monitoring and evaluation: ensuring the implementation of intelligence Establish a sound evaluation system: Formulate a scientific and reasonable evaluation index system to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the construction of smart scenic spots, and find and adjust problems in a timely manner. Strengthen data monitoring and analysis: Real-time monitoring of key indicator data, such as the number of tourists, satisfaction, consumption levels, etc., and use data analysis technology to evaluate the effectiveness of intelligent construction. Continuous optimization and iteration: According to the monitoring and evaluation results, continuously optimize and iterate the smart scenic spot solutions to ensure that the intelligent construction continues to empower the development of the scenic spot. Summary The construction of smart scenic spots is a systematic project that requires the joint efforts of scenic spots, governments, technology companies and other parties. Only by truly being tourist-centered, paying attention to top-level design, and being data-driven can we create truly intelligent scenic spots and achieve high-quality development of scenic spots.
